## üíª Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to get the Schedula API server running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**: Ensure you have a compatible Python version installed.
- **uv**: The `uv` package manager is used for dependency management. If you don't have `uv` installed, you can install it via:

  **macOS and Linux:**

  ```bash
  curl -LsSf [https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh](https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh) | sh
  ```

  **Windows (PowerShell, run as Administrator):**

  ```powershell
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm [https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1](https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1) | iex"
  ```

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project repository and navigate to the `neondb` branch:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/codex-mohan/schedula.git](https://github.com/codex-mohan/schedula.git)
cd schedula
git checkout neondb
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

Use `uv` to install all project dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 3\. Set Up Environment Variables

This project uses a Neon PostgreSQL database for persistent storage. You'll need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

**a) Get Your Neon DB Connection String:**

1.  Sign up for a free account at [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/).
2.  Create a new project.
3.  On your project dashboard, locate and copy the **Connection String**. It will look something like:
    `postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]/[dbname]?sslmode=require`

**b) Create a `.env` file:**
In the root directory of your project (same level as `main.py`), create a file named `.env` and add your Neon database connection string:

```dotenv
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]/[dbname]?sslmode=require"
```

Replace `[user]`, `[password]`, `[host]`, and `[dbname]` with your actual Neon credentials.

### 4\. Database Schema Creation and Migration

Your application's database schema (tables for patients, doctors, appointments) will be automatically created when the `main.py` application starts up for the first time.

**If you are updating an existing database schema (e.g., adding the `timings` column to `doctors` table):**

1.  **Manually add the `timings` column to your `doctors` table in Neon.** Go to your Neon Dashboard, open the **SQL Editor**, and run the following SQL command:
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE doctors ADD COLUMN timings JSONB DEFAULT '[]';
    ```
    This step is crucial for existing databases to recognize the new column.
2.  **Ensure `doctors.json` is updated** with the `timings` data for each doctor.
3.  **Run the migration script:** Execute the `migrate_doctors.py` script once. This will read doctors from your local `doctors.json` and insert them into your Neon database.
    ```bash
    python migrate_doctors.py
    ```
    > **Note:** This script will only run if the `doctors` table is empty to prevent duplicate entries. If you have existing data and want to re-populate it with timings, you might need to clear the `doctors` table first (e.g., `DELETE FROM doctors;` in Neon's SQL Editor) before running the migration script.

### 5\. Run the Application

Once dependencies are installed and environment variables are set, start the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can view the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

- **Doctor Availability Enforcement:** Integrate the `timings` data to prevent booking appointments outside a doctor's declared availability.
- **Notifications:** Add email or SMS notifications for appointment confirmations, reminders, and changes.
- **Search and Filtering:** Enhance search capabilities for appointments and doctors with more advanced filtering options (e.g., by department, status, date range).
- **Frontend Integration:** Develop a user-friendly web or mobile frontend to interact with this API.
- **Admin Panel:** Create a dedicated interface for administrators to manage patients, doctors, and appointments.
- **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests for all API endpoints.
